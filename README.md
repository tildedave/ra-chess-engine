New chess engine - Ra the sun god succeeded Apep the serpent god.

My last chess engine was written in C++ and also [available on Github](github.com/tildedave/apep-chess-engine).

Trying a few different things with this one (different language, different board representation) and trying to keep the code cleaner.
